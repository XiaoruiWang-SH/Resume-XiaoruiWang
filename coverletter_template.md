Dear Hiring Team,

I bring with me approximately seven years of software development experience in large-scale IT companies, including JD.com—one of China’s largest e-commerce platforms and a Fortune Global 500 company—and ZTO Express, a leading logistics provider in China. In early 2024, I made the decision to leave my full-time role and pursue a Master’s degree in Computer Science at Università della Svizzera italiana (USI) in Switzerland. This journey reflects both my commitment to personal growth and my belief in stepping beyond my comfort zone to embrace new challenges.

My years of industry experience have given me a strong foundation in software development workflows, team collaboration, and project execution—skills that allow me to operate efficiently in fast-paced, real-world environments. Through my academic studies, I’ve deepened and broadened my technical understanding across areas such as algorithms, systems design, and advanced software engineering. I now combine practical experience with a systematic and critical understanding of technology.

I have a diverse technical background covering frontend, backend, mobile development, and DevOps. This allows me to contribute flexibly across multiple roles and to quickly learn new tools and technologies as needed. I naturally take a holistic view of systems and enjoy designing solutions with long-term scalability and maintainability in mind.

Personally, I am a highly self-driven individual with strong execution skills, curiosity, and a desire to understand the essence of problems. I believe in the power of time, focus, and continuous improvement—and I maintain a deep passion for both life and technology.

I have great respect and admiration for BMW’s century-long legacy of innovation and excellence. For a company to remain a global leader for over 100 years, it must embody constant reinvention, visionary thinking, and an internal drive for progress—qualities that deeply resonate with my own values. I truly believe I can contribute meaningfully to your teams while embracing and enhancing the culture that has made BMW what it is today.

Thank you for considering my application. I would be honored to be part of your journey into the future.


Sincerely,

Xiaorui Wang
