Dear Hiring Team,

I am excited to express my interest in the Master’s Thesis position at ABB.

I bring with me approximately seven years of professional software development experience in large IT companies, including JD.com (one of China’s largest e-commerce platforms and a Fortune Global 500 company) and ZTO Express (one of China’s leading logistics companies). In early 2024, I made the pivotal decision to leave my job and pursue a Master’s degree in Computer Science at Università della Svizzera italiana (USI) in Switzerland, further enriching my technical foundation and expanding my understanding of computer science in both breadth and depth.

Throughout my career, I have accumulated extensive experience with software development processes, team collaboration, and project delivery — giving me a perspective that goes beyond that of a typical entry-level candidate. My technical skill set is broad, covering frontend, backend, mobile development, and DevOps. I am confident in my ability to adapt quickly to new roles and technologies, always approaching solutions with a comprehensive, system-wide perspective.

Beyond my professional and academic background, I am someone with strong self-motivation, creativity, and execution power. I consistently seek to step out of my comfort zone and challenge myself — a principle that is reflected throughout my career and educational journey. For instance, in my recent personal project [TODOCalendar](https://todocalendar.live/), I independently built and deployed a full-stack application from scratch using JavaScript/TypeScript/React/Redux for the frontend and Java/Spring Boot/MySQL for the backend, (see the code repo in my github: [https://github.com/XiaoruiWang-SH](https://github.com/XiaoruiWang-SH))successfully hosting it on cloud services.

I am deeply impressed by ABB’s century-long legacy of innovation and resilience. Your company’s commitment to technology, sustainability, and continuous renewal resonates strongly with my own beliefs about growth and impact. I am confident that I would be an excellent fit for ABB’s culture and values, and I am eager to contribute my skills, passion, and drive to your Smart Power division.

Thank you very much for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to ABB’s mission and growing together with your outstanding team.

Best regards,

Xiaorui Wang
