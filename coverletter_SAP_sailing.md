Dear SAP Recruitment Team,

I am excited to apply for the internship opportunity at SAP. With approximately seven years of professional experience in software development at leading IT companies—most notably JD.com (one of China’s largest e-commerce platforms and a Fortune Global 500 company) and ZTO Express (a major logistics provider in China)—I bring both deep technical expertise and practical industry insights.

At the beginning of 2024, I made a bold decision to leave my job and pursue a Master’s degree in Computer Science at the Università della Svizzera italiana (USI) in Switzerland. This academic journey has not only enhanced my theoretical foundations but also expanded my technical horizons, enabling me to approach problems with both practical experience and academic rigor.

My technical skill set spans frontend, backend, mobile development, and DevOps. I’m a fast learner, comfortable wearing multiple hats, and capable of quickly adapting to different roles and technologies. My broad technical vision allows me to design solutions from a holistic perspective and contribute meaningfully to complex projects.

I have a strong drive for execution, innovation, and self-motivation—qualities that have defined my professional path. My prior work focused heavily on frontend and mobile applications, which makes me particularly well-suited for this position. In a recent personal project, TODOCalendar, I independently built and deployed a full-stack application using JavaScript/TypeScript, React, Redux for the frontend, and Java/Spring Boot with MySQL for the backend—all hosted on cloud infrastructure.

Although I’m new to the world of sailing, I’m an enthusiastic sports lover and genuinely intrigued by sailing as a discipline. I’m confident that my passion for learning, curiosity about new domains, and user-centered thinking will allow me to understand and enhance the end-user experience effectively.

I deeply resonate with SAP’s culture of collaboration, innovation, and purpose-driven work. I believe SAP is a vibrant and forward-thinking company, and I am eager to contribute to its continued success. I’m excited about the opportunity to join your team and make meaningful contributions to this inspiring project.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,

Xiaorui Wang
