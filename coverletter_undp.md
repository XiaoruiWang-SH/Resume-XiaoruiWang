Dear UNDP Hiring Team,

With over seven years of professional software development experience at leading IT enterprises—including JD.com, one of China’s largest e-commerce platforms and a Fortune Global 500 company, and ZTO Express, the country’s top logistics service provider—I have developed deep expertise in full-cycle software engineering, cross-functional collaboration, and large-scale system design.

In early 2024, I made a pivotal decision to further elevate my technical and academic foundation by pursuing a Master of Science in Informatics at Università della Svizzera italiana (USI) in Switzerland. This transition has not only deepened my theoretical knowledge in computer science but also strengthened my ability to approach problems from a broader and more structured perspective.

Throughout my career and academic journey, I have cultivated a versatile technical skillset covering frontend, backend, mobile development, and DevOps. My recent personal project,a web application, TODOCalendar (deployed at https://todocalendar.live), showcases my ability to independently design and implement a full-stack application using modern technologies such as HTML/CSS/JavaScript/TypeScript/React/Redux/Responsive design on the frontend, and Java/Spring Boot/MySQL/RESTful api on the backend. And also I have deployed this web application in docker in clound server and complished with CI/CD pipelines GitHub Actions configuration.

What sets me apart is my strong sense of ownership, proactive mindset, and passion for continuous learning. I thrive in environments that encourage initiative and innovation. My career reflects a consistent willingness to step out of my comfort zone and embrace new challenges—qualities I believe are well aligned with UNDP’s mission of inclusive development and sustainable progress.

I am deeply inspired by UNDP’s global impact and its commitment to empowering communities through technology and innovation. It would be an honor to contribute my skills and experience to such a meaningful cause, and to collaborate with a diverse and talented international team working toward a better future.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to contribute to UNDP’s ongoing digital transformation and innovation efforts.

Warm regards,

Xiaorui Wang
