Dear Hiring Team,

With approximately seven years of software development experience in leading IT enterprises—including JD.com (one of China’s largest e-commerce platforms and a Fortune Global 500 company) and ZTO Express (one of China’s largest logistics companies)—I bring strong professional and technical expertise to the table. In early 2024, I made the bold decision to leave full-time work and pursue a Master’s degree in Computer Science at USI in Switzerland, aiming to further deepen and broaden my technical foundation.

My industry experience has given me an in-depth understanding of agile development, team collaboration, and large-scale system design. This, combined with my academic training, has allowed me to refine a systematic and comprehensive understanding of computer science. I have a versatile technical background, covering front-end, back-end, mobile development, and DevOps, which enables me to quickly adapt to different roles and environments. I always strive to take a global view when designing technical solutions.

Driven, curious, and self-motivated, I constantly challenge myself to grow beyond my comfort zone. In one of my recent personal projects, TODOCalendar, I independently developed and deployed a full-stack web application using JavaScript/TypeScript/React/Redux for the frontend and Java/Spring Boot/MySQL for the backend. This hands-on experience sharpened my end-to-end development skills and solidified my passion for creating impactful software.

Although I have not previously worked at Oracle, I have always admired the company’s long-standing legacy, innovation-driven spirit, and global impact. I deeply resonate with Oracle’s values and believe I can thrive in its culture of excellence. I am eager to bring my experience, passion for technology, and lifelong learning mindset to contribute to Oracle’s continued success.

Thank you very much for considering my application. I would be excited to further discuss how my background aligns with your team’s goals.

Sincerely,

Xiaorui Wang
