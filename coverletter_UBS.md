Dear Recruitment Team,

I bring with me over seven years of experience in software development at leading IT enterprises, including JD.com—one of China’s largest e-commerce platforms and a Fortune Global 500 company—and ZTO Express, a major logistics provider in China. In early 2024, I made a pivotal decision to leave my job and pursue a Master’s degree in Computer Science at Università della Svizzera italiana (USI) in Switzerland.

My professional background has equipped me with extensive knowledge of the software development lifecycle and strong collaboration skills—assets that distinguish me from junior candidates. Through my graduate studies, I have further developed a solid and structured understanding of computer science, broadening and deepening my technical expertise.

I am proficient across a wide range of technologies, including frontend, backend, mobile development, and DevOps, which allows me to adapt quickly and contribute effectively to different roles. I have a broad technical perspective and am capable of approaching challenges from a holistic, system-level viewpoint.

Personally, I am a highly motivated, execution-driven individual who enjoys stepping out of my comfort zone and taking on challenges—something that is evident from my career and life choices. For example, in my recent personal project “TODOCalendar,” I independently built a full-stack solution using JavaScript/TypeScript/React/Redux on the frontend, and Java/Spring Boot/MySQL on the backend. The application is now successfully deployed on a cloud platform.

My passion lies in understanding the essence of systems and improving user experience through thoughtful engineering. I am a firm believer in lifelong learning, and I maintain a strong curiosity about technology and a deep love for building meaningful products.

I greatly admire UBS for its long-standing legacy, global impact, and vibrant corporate culture. I am eager to contribute my experience, energy, and dedication to the continued success and innovation of your organization. I am confident that my background and mindset align well with the values and vision of UBS.

Thank you very much for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to contribute to your team.

Sincerely,

Xiaorui Wang
