Application for Mobile App Development Internship

Dear Ms. Tombetti,

I am writing to apply for the Mobile App Development internship at adesso. As a current Master’s student in Informatics at Università della Svizzera italiana (USI) and a former senior iOS engineer with several years of professional experience, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to adesso’s banking-focused mobile solutions while learning from your multidisciplinary teams.

About me:
	1.	I am currently studying at USI (Università della Svizzera italiana) in Lugano as a Master’s student in Informatics, and I live in Lugano as well.
	2.	My expected graduation date is February 2026. I have only one semester left, which will be dedicated to my thesis and involves almost no coursework. This means I will have plenty of time for this internship and can start at any time.
	3.	To clarify, I am from China and currently hold a B permit for education purposes. Therefore, I would require a work permit to undertake this internship.

What I would bring to adesso:
	1.	Expertise in mobile and cross-platform development:
	•	Previously, I worked mainly as an iOS developer up to the senior level before starting my Master’s degree. I also gained experience with cross-platform technologies such as Flutter and hybrid app development.
	•	During my Master’s studies, I have explored Android development, frontend, and full-stack development—both through coursework and self-study. I’ve built hands-on projects that can be found in my resume and on my GitHub: https://github.com/XiaoruiWang-SH
	2.	Ability to seamlessly integrate into the workplace:
	•	With years of experience as a software developer, I am familiar with professional work environments, development processes, and commonly used tools and practices, including Git, debugging, unit testing, agile methodologies, CI/CD, and clean code principles.
	•	Regardless of your tech stack, I am confident that I can adapt quickly and become productive in a short time.

Why this internship is a perfect fit:

My interests are not limited to a specific area like iOS, Android, or frontend, but rather span the broader field often referred to as the “big frontend” or “user-end,” which encompasses all three platforms. I have observed that many complex problems across these platforms cannot be solved with a single technology stack. Modern challenges, such as cross-platform development, require an integrated approach involving iOS, Android, and web technologies. This internship aligns perfectly with my career direction and would be a meaningful step in my professional growth.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background and ambitions align with adesso’s goals. Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my CV and can provide references or code samples upon request.

Kind regards,
Xiaorui Wang
