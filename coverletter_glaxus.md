## Application for iOS Software Engineer Position  

Dear Hiring Team at Galaxus,  

I am writing to express my enthusiasm for the opportunity to join Galaxus as an iOS Software Engineer. With over seven years of software development experience at leading technology companies, including JD.com (one of China’s largest e-commerce platforms and a Fortune Global 500 company) and ZTO Express (China’s leading express delivery company), I bring a proven track record of delivering high-impact technical solutions in the e-commerce and logistics sectors. My expertise in iOS development, coupled with my broader technical proficiency across frontend, backend, and cross-platform technologies, aligns closely with Galaxus’ mission to deliver exceptional digital experiences.  

At JD.com, where I served as an iOS Software Engineer since October 2020, I spearheaded the design and optimization of the JDHybrid container architecture, a high-availability solution supporting over 100 million daily page views and 4,000+ domains across 140 business units and 12 apps. By implementing offline package preloading and interface prefetching, I improved H5 page load times by 54.5% (from 29.5% to 84% instant load rate), reduced error rates by 92%, and enhanced performance by 30%. Due to my oustanding performance I was promoted to P7 from P6 within 2 years with 30% salary increase, recognized with Top Performer (A+) in 2022.

Prior to JD.com, at ZTO Express, I led the development and modernization of the Tu Xi Express Supermarket iOS app using Swift, achieving a 60% performance improvement and an 80% reduction in crash rates. Additionally, I pioneered a cross-platform strategy with Flutter, streamlining development and ensuring a consistent user experience across iOS and Android. My contributions earned me two promotions for technical leadership and impact.  

Since early 2024, I have been pursuing a Master’s degree in Computer Science at USI (Università della Svizzera italiana), with 1.5 years of my 2-year program completed. This academic journey has deepened my technical expertise and broadened my understanding of computer science, equipping me with a robust foundation in frontend, backend, DevOps, and database technologies. I consider myself a T-shaped professional, with deep expertise in iOS development and a versatile skill set that enables me to design holistic technical solutions, learn rapidly, and collaborate effectively across teams—a foundation I believe is critical for roles like technical architect or CTO.  

As a satisfied Galaxus customer, I admire your commitment to user experience but see immense potential to elevate your technical capabilities. I am eager to apply my experience from JD.com to enhance Galaxus’ platform, driving performance, scalability, and innovation. If required, I am willing to pause my studies to fully dedicate myself to this role.  

I am a proactive, self-driven individual with a passion for lifelong learning and a curiosity for uncovering the essence of challenges. My journey—from thriving in high-pressure roles at JD.com and ZTO to pursuing advanced studies in Switzerland—reflects my willingness to step out of my comfort zone and embrace new challenges. I am genuinely excited about the opportunity to contribute to Galaxus’ vision, integrate into your culture, and help build a world-class product. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experiences can contribute to Galaxus’ success.  

Sincerely,  
Xiaorui Wang
