Dear Mobility Recruitment Team,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the position at Mobility, and I would like to share why I believe I am an excellent fit for this role.

With nearly seven years of software development experience at leading IT companies, including JD.com (one of the largest e-commerce platforms in China and a Fortune Global 500 company) and ZTO Express (one of the largest logistics companies in China), I have developed a deep technical expertise. Throughout my career, I have primarily worked as an iOS Software Engineer, while also gaining experience in front-end and back-end development.

In early 2024, I made the decision to pursue a Master’s degree in Computer Science at USI University in Switzerland. I have completed 1.5 years of my studies, and I am currently in the final stages of my program. If selected for this role, I am open to pausing my studies to fully dedicate myself to the position, should it be required by the company.

My academic journey has greatly enriched my technical skillset, allowing me to expand my knowledge across a range of areas. Beyond mastering iOS development, I have gained substantial expertise in front-end, back-end, mobile, and operations engineering, enabling me to take on diverse roles and learn new technologies quickly. I possess a broad technical perspective, which allows me to consider solutions from a global standpoint and make decisions that align with overall technical strategy.

Personally, I am a highly driven individual with a passion for exploring the essence of problems. I am not afraid to step out of my comfort zone and take on challenges, a quality that is reflected in both my professional journey and academic endeavors. My commitment to continuous learning drives me to stay curious about both technology and life, maintaining a strong passion for both.

I have been impressed with Mobility’s services, having personally used your car rental offerings, and I deeply admire the company’s focus on delivering an exceptional user experience. I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to join your team and contribute my skills to help further improve Mobility’s products and services.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how my background and experiences align with your team’s needs.

Sincerely,

Xiaorui Wang
